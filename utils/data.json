    "document": "The Altman brothers sure have a knack for being venture capitalists. On Tuesday, this especially applied to Jack Altman, co-founder of $3 billion-valuation HR software startup Lattice and brother to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nJack Altman just announced a second $275 million fund for his solo-run firm Alt Capital. And from start to finish, it took him a week, he told The Wall Street Journal. His first fund, raised in early 2024, was $150 million, so this is a big step up. He used it to invest in about 20 early-stage companies, he said, including David AI (a YC-alum that does data sets for speech models) and unicorn restaurant software maker Owner.com.\n\nJack is, clearly, well-connected and has founder experience, although he left the CEO role at Lattice in 2024 (he remains chairman). Of course, Sam was famously president of Y Combinator and is still an active angel investor (but not an LP in this new fund, the WSJ reports). Meanwhile, brother Max Altman is a co-founder of Saga Ventures, which raised a $125 million fund of its own in 2024.",

    "document": "Tesla is recalling Powerwall 2 home batteries in Australia after the company received reports of fires that led to 'minor property damage,' according to the Australia Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).\n\nThe recall affects an unspecified number of Powerwall 2 units made in the U.S. and sold between November 2020 and June 2022. The cells were made by an unnamed third-party supplier. Despite the fires, no injuries have been reported, the ACCC said in a recall notice.\n\nThe Powerwall 2 contains 14 kWh of lithium ion batteries, and it is usually installed alongside solar panels to store excess power generated during the day.\n\nCustomers can also enroll their batteries in a virtual power plant to support the grid in times of heavy load. Enrolling extends the warranty to up to 15 years and gives customers access to time-of-use rates that will help reduce energy bills, Tesla says.\n\nHomeowners will be notified in the Tesla app if their Powerwall is part of the recall, and the company is in the process of discharging the batteries to reduce the risk of fire. Recalled batteries will be replaced free of charge, and the company 'will consider compensation for lost energy savings … on a case-by-case basis,' the ACCC said.",

    "document": "Harjot Gill was running FluxNinja, an observability startup he co-founded several years after selling his first startup Netsil to Nutanix in 2018, when he noticed a curious trend.\n\n'We had a team of remote engineers who were starting to adopt AI code generation on GitHub Copilot,' Gill told TechCrunch. 'We saw that adoption happen, and it was very clear to me that as a second-order effect, it’s going to cause bottlenecks in the code review.'\n\nIn early 2023, Gill started CodeRabbit, an AI-powered code review platform, and it acquired FlexNinja.\n\nGill’s prediction has come true: developers are now regularly using AI coding assistants to generate code, but the output is often buggy, forcing engineers to spend a lot of time on corrections.\n\nCodeRabbit can help catch some of the errors. The business has been growing 20% a month and is now making more than $15 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), according to Gill.\n\nInvestors find the startup’s growth exciting. On Tuesday, CodeRabbit announced that it raised a $60 million Series B, valuing the company at $550 million. The round, which brought the startup’s total funding to $88 million, was led by Scale Venture Partners with participation of NVentures, Nvidia’s venture capital arm, and returning investors including CRV.\n\nCodeRabbit is helping companies like Chegg, Groupon, and Mercury, along with over 8,000 other businesses, save time on the famously frustrating task of code review, which has become even more time-consuming with the rise of AI-generated code. Since CodeRabbit understands a company’s codebase, it can identify bugs and provide feedback, acting like a coworker, Gill said. He added that companies using CodeRabbit can cut the number of humans working on code-review by half.",

    "document": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced on Tuesday a raft of new user policies, including a pledge to significantly change how ChatGPT interacts with users under the age of 18.\n\n'We prioritize safety ahead of privacy and freedom for teens,' the post reads. 'This is a new and powerful technology, and we believe minors need significant protection.'\n\nThe changes for underage users deal specifically with conversations involving sexual topics or self-harm. Under the new policy, ChatGPT will be trained to no longer engage in 'flirtatious talk' with underage users, and additional guardrails will be placed around discussions of suicide. If an underage user uses ChatGPT to imagine suicidal scenarios, the service will attempt to contact their parents or, in particularly severe cases, local police.\n\nSadly, these scenarios are not hypotheticals. OpenAI is currently facing a wrongful death lawsuit from the parents of Adam Raine, who died by suicide after months of interactions with ChatGPT. Character.AI, another consumer chatbot, is facing a similar lawsuit. While the risks are particularly urgent for underage users considering self-harm, the broader phenomenon of chatbot-fueled delusion has drawn widespread concern, particularly as consumer chatbots have become capable of more sustained and detailed interactions.\n\nAlong with the content-based restrictions, parents who register an underage user account will have the power to set 'blackout hours' in which ChatGPT is not available, a feature that was not previously available.\n\nThe new ChatGPT policies come on the same day as a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing titled 'Examining the Harm of AI Chatbots.' The hearing was announced by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) in August. Adam Raine’s father is scheduled to speak at the hearing, among other guests.\n\nThe hearing will also focus on the findings of a Reuters investigation that unearthed policy documents apparently encouraging sexual conversations with underage users. Meta updated its chatbot policies in the wake of the report.",

    "document": "At its Made on YouTube live event on Tuesday, the company unveiled new generative AI tools for Shorts creators. YouTube is bringing a custom version of Google’s text-to-video generative AI model, Veo 3, to Shorts, along with a new remixing tool, an 'Edit with AI' feature, and more.\n\nThe custom version of Veo 3, called Veo 3 Fast, generates outputs with lower latency at 480p, making it easy to create video clips, YouTube says. And now users can do so with sound for the first time.\n\nThis update is rolling out in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. YouTube plans to expand its functionality to more regions in the future. YouTube is also bringing new Veo capabilities to Shorts, including the ability to apply motion from a video to an image. For example, you could animate a still image by making the person in it do a dance from a video. The company says this is possible through technology that captures and transfers movement from one subject to another.\n\nCreators can now also use Veo to apply different styles to their videos, such as pop art or origami. Plus, creators now have the ability to add objects like characters or props with text descriptions.\n\n'As the world’s largest creative playground, YouTube is where trends are born and where you can draw inspiration from. Imagine hearing a line of dialogue that sparks an idea — a funny phrase, a memorable quote, or a one-of-a-kind sound — and you want to remix it into a new sound,' YouTube’s Director of Product, Shorts and Generative AI Creation, Dina Berrada, wrote in a blog post. 'With our new Speech to Song remixing tool, you’ll be able to do just that.'\n\nYouTube notes that the feature uses Google’s AI music model Lyria 2 to create the soundtrack. Creators will be able to add their own vibe to the song, like 'chill,' 'danceable,' or 'fun.'",

Using AI, these creators will be able to generate a customizable video for their podcast, the company says. However, the feature will only be available to 'select podcasters' when it launches, with a larger expansion planned for later in 2026.",

Most notably, YouTube is going to allow creators to swap out brand sponsorships in long-form videos.\n\nThe company is also introducing auto timestamps for product tags, auto tagging for eligible items mentioned in videos, and a new brand link feature for Shorts.\n\nThe new flexible approach to brand sponsorships will allow creators to dynamically insert brand segments directly into swappable slots in longer videos. This means that when a deal with a brand is complete, creators can remove the sponsorship from the video and resell the slot to another brand. YouTube will begin testing this feature with a small group of creators early next year.\n\nThe company is also going to leverage an AI-powered system to identify the optimal moment a product is mentioned and automatically display the product tag at that time. YouTube says this will capture viewer interest when it’s at its highest. Plus, the platform will begin testing the ability to automatically identify and tag all eligible products mentioned in a creator’s video later this year.\n\nAs for Shorts creators, they will soon be able to add a link to a brand’s site specifically for brand deals, making it easier for viewers to discover and buy products, while allowing creators to drive results for brand partners. Creators will be able to show advertisers how their Shorts drive traffic in a way that goes beyond traditional metrics like views and likes, YouTube says. YouTube also announced that it will soon be able to proactively suggest creators who may be a good fit for brands in its creator partnerships hub, which is a tab within Google Ads that helps brands connect with creators.",

    "document": "Google announced a new open protocol for purchases initiated by AI agents — automated software programs that can shop and make decisions on behalf of users — with backing from more than 60 merchants and financial institutions. Called the Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), the system is meant to be interoperable between AI platforms, payment systems and vendors, providing a traceable paper trail for each transaction. In a post announcing the protocol, Google executives emphasized their commitment to openness. “We are committed to evolving this protocol in an open, collaborative process, including through standards bodies, and invite the entire payments and technology community to build this future with us,” wrote Stavan Parikh and Rao Surapaneni, who are VPs at Google and Google Cloud, respectively. The full specification for AP2 was posted to GitHub in conjunction with the announcement. The protocol is built for a future in which AI agents routinely shop for products on customers’ behalf and engage in complex real-time interactions with retailers’ AI agents. One example in Google’s post imagines a chatbot user asking their agent to shop for a bike trip, which triggers a spontaneous time-sensitive bundle offer from a bike shop’s agent. In another example, a user asks for travel and lodging for a weekend vacation, giving only the dates, location, and budget. “The agent can then interact with both airline and hotel agents, as well as online travel agencies and booking platforms,” the post explains, “and once it finds a combination that fits the budget, it can execute both cryptographically-signed bookings simultaneously.” Enabling that kind of transaction is complex, from both a technological and social standpoint. AP2 requires agents to register two separate approvals before a purchase can be made: first the “intent mandate” (essentially telling the AI, “I’m looking for a polka-dot necktie”), which enables the agent to search for a specific item and negotiate with sellers; then the “cart mandate,” which gives final approval for a purchase once a specific item has been found. The protocol also contains a provision for fully automated purchases, in which the agent is permitted to automatically generate a cart mandate once an item is found. Those circumstances require a more detailed intent mandate, specifying price limits, timing, and other rules of engagement. In either case, the goal is to maintain an auditable trail that can be reexamined in cases of fraud.",
